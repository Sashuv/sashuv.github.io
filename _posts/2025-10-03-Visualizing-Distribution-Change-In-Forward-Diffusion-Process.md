# KaTeX Test Post

This is a **test** to check if KaTeX is rendering LaTeX correctly.

---

## Inline Math

You can write inline math like this:

The normal distribution is written as \( X \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) \).

You can also write simple equations inline: \( E[X] = \mu \) and \( \text{Var}(X) = \sigma^2 \).

---

## Block Math

Block equations are written like this:

$$
X_t = \sqrt{1-\beta_t} \, X_{t-1} + \sqrt{\beta_t} \, \epsilon, \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)
$$

Another example:

$$
\int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}
$$

## Fractions and Summations

You can also test fractions, sums, and products:

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}
$$

$$
y = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d}
$$
